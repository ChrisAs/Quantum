			I simply have the “gay gene” according to some. It’s there in my DNA. I was born with auburn hair. I was born gay. There is nothing I can do about either (except the auburn hair is fading whilst the same-sex attraction is not).
		</p>

		<p>
			The problem is that the existence of a “gay gene” is really an urban myth – the result of some journalistic spinning of some inconclusive scientific studies. But even if true, it would not make sex with someone of the same sex morally neutral. All of us have genetic dispositions that lead to behaviour the Bible condemns. Comments like “He has his father’s temper,” or, <span>“The Smith family has a long history of alcohol problems,”</span> are regularly heard. They rightly help us understand someone’s behaviour (and increase our empathy) but don’t stop us from holding people responsible for their own anger and drunkenness.

		First up is the doctrine of original sin. The Bible’s teaching that – as a result of the Fall – all human beings are now marred image bearers of God. We were once perfect (and so still have an inbuilt desire for perfection) but are now imperfect. All human beings have been born sinners – with an in-built tendency to live for themselves rather than for God or for others. That doesn’t stop us doing good things (God’s image is still there) but it does mean that we do bad things instinctively (his image has been that marred in us). The Bible clearly teaches that all human beings sin naturally. But the Bible also clearly shows that all human beings have a propensity to sin differently.

				Moses had an anger problem. For David his weakness was sex. For Peter it was pride. For Ed Shaw it is (amongst other things), same-sex sexual immorality.
